# intro 
so this is just a simple automation that is created to automate some of my manual work in my intership, you can use this code as an idea to implement this automation code.

# automation.py
our main code file where all the logic of the code is written

# creds.py
as we can see in automation.py we have imported a file creds .
that file contains the login credential for the website login page and the name of the technician to be searched.
anyone using the repo can make their own creds.py file in the project main directory with their username and password.

# variables.py
and similarly for the file where all the variables including website url and element's Id are stored that are to be used in the project
